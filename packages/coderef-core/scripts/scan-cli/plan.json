  "status": "planned",

  "goal": "Create a simple Node.js CLI tool that wraps the TypeScript scanner for command-line usage, allowing users to scan projects without opening the Dashboard UI.",

  "requirements": [
    "CLI executable that accepts project path as argument",
    "Imports and uses existing @coderef/core scanner (scanCurrentElements)",
    "Prints scan results to stdout (element count, file count, duration)",
    "Simple error handling for invalid paths or scan failures",
    "Usage documentation (USAGE.md) following same format as setup_coderef_dirs.py docs"
  ],

  "constraints": [
    "Must use existing TypeScript scanner (no duplication)",
    "Keep it simple - under 50 lines of code",
    "No dependencies beyond @coderef/core",
    "Must work from any directory (not just coderef-dashboard root)",
    "Windows-compatible (primary target)"
