  "description": "Complete scanner integration with 7 major improvements: AST integration for 95% accuracy, parallel processing for 3-5x performance, LRU caching, relationship tracking, dynamic imports support, and progress reporting",
  "goal": "Transform scanner from regex-only to hybrid AST+regex system with parallel processing, achieving 95% accuracy and 3-5x performance improvement",
  "requirements": [
    "Hybrid AST + regex integration for 95% accuracy (up from 85%)",
    "Parallel file processing with worker threads for 3-5x performance",
    "LRU caching system with memory cap for repeated scans",
    "Relationship tracking (imports, dependencies, function calls)",
    "Dynamic import support with ESM detection",
    "Real-time progress reporting with streaming results",
    "Update communication.json after each task completion"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "CLI tool changes (focus on core library only)",
    "Breaking API changes to existing scanner interface",
    "UI dashboard integration (scanner UI already exists)"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Maintain backward compatibility with existing scanCurrentElements API",
    "No breaking changes to ElementData interface",
    "Must work with existing preset system",
    "Performance improvements must be measurable and documented"
