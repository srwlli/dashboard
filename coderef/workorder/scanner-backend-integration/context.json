  "feature_name": "scanner-backend-integration",
  "description": "Wire the Scanner page UI mockup to a working backend that manages projects and executes scan-all.py scans. UI already exists at /scanner route with ProjectListCard, ConsoleTabs, and ActionBar components - need to add API routes, subprocess execution, and real-time output streaming to match the functionality of the Python Tkinter Scanner GUI.",
  "goal": "Enable users to add/remove projects, select multiple projects, click \"Scan Projects\" button, and see real-time scan output in the console tab - replacing the current UI-only mockup with fully functional scanner that calls scan-all.py via Node.js child_process.",
  "requirements": [
    "Add POST/GET/DELETE endpoints at /api/scanner/projects for managing saved projects",
    "Store projects in ~/.coderef-scanner-projects.json matching Python GUI behavior",
    "Add POST endpoint at /api/scanner/scan to trigger batch scanning",
    "Execute scan-all.py via Node.js child_process.spawn for each selected project",
    "Stream real-time output using Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint",
    "Update ProjectListCard to fetch and display real projects (replace mockup)",
    "Wire 'Add Path' button to Electron IPC fs:selectDirectory dialog",
    "Update ConsoleTabs to consume SSE stream and display real-time output",
    "Wire ActionBar 'Scan Projects' button to trigger POST /api/scanner/scan",
    "Track scan status (idle, scanning, complete) and update UI accordingly",
    "Support cancelling running scans",
    "Handle errors gracefully (path not found, Python missing, scan failures)"
