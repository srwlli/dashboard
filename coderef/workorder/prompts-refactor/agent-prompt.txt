You are an expert implementation planner. Generate a detailed, executable plan for this feature:

**FEATURE:** prompts-refactor

**DESCRIPTION:** Remove SessionManager from /session page and rename the page to /prompts. The page should only contain PromptingWorkflow since we now have a dedicated SessionsHub at /sessions for session management.

**GOAL:** Clean up after creating SessionsHub - eliminate duplicate session management UI and make the prompts page dedicated to prompting workflow only

**REQUIREMENTS (6 total):**
- Remove SessionManager component import and usage from the page
- Rename /app/session directory to /app/prompts
- Update navigation links in sidebar to point to /prompts
- Keep all PromptingWorkflow functionality intact
- Update page title, description, and metadata to reflect prompts focus
- Update any route references from /session to /prompts

**CONSTRAINTS (3 total):**
- Don't delete SessionManager component file (might be used elsewhere)
- No breaking changes to PromptingWorkflow functionality
- Preserve all prompting workflow sub-components

**CRITICAL: You have COMPLETE codebase context. USE IT EXPLICITLY.**

**CODE INVENTORY (.coderef/index.json):**
- Total elements: 6
- Available: Functions, classes, components with exact file paths and line numbers

**CODING PATTERNS (.coderef/reports/patterns.json):**
- 5 patterns identified
- Includes: Error handling patterns, naming conventions, code organization rules

**DEPENDENCY GRAPH (.coderef/graph.json):**
- 5559 nodes in dependency graph
- Use for: Dependency analysis, impact assessment, task ordering

**TEST COVERAGE (.coderef/reports/coverage.json):**
- Overall coverage: unknown%
- Use for: Identifying test gaps, planning test strategy

## Overview

The CodeRef Dashboard is a modular widget system with PWA and Electron support, designed to aggregate and visualize workorder and stub data from multiple project directories. The system follows a monorepo architecture with three primary packages.

**Core Purpose:** Provide a unified dashboard interface for tracking workorders (active work) and stubs (backlog items) across multiple software projects.

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive API reference for the CodeRef Dashboard backend. The dashboard aggregates workorder and stub data from multiple projects using Next.js API Routes.

**Key Architecture:**
- Next.js 14 API Routes (App Router)
- File-based API endpoints in `packages/dashboard/src/app/api/`
- Reads data from multiple project directories via `projects.config.json`
- RESTful JSON respon...

**YOUR TASK - Generate Implementation Plan**

You MUST create a plan.json following the 10-section structure below.

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS** (use coderef data):
   - Check which existing functions/classes this feature depends on (use index.json)
   - Identify which files will be modified (check code inventory for exact paths)
   - Analyze dependency chains (use graph.json if available)

2. **PATTERN ADHERENCE** (use patterns.json):
   - Follow existing coding patterns from patterns.json
   - Match error handling approaches
   - Use established naming conventions

3. **TASK BREAKDOWN** (be SPECIFIC - most important):
   - Break each requirement into FILE-LEVEL tasks
   - Example: "IMPL-001: Modify src/auth/jwt.service.ts lines 45-60 - add generateRefreshToken() method"
   - NOT: "IMPL-001: Implement JWT tokens"
   - Include exact file paths from code inventory
   - Reference specific line numbers where changes occur

4. **PHASE PLANNING** (use dependencies):
   - Order tasks by dependency (what must happen first?)
   - Identify parallel vs sequential work
   - Create realistic phases (not always 4!)
   - Add "dependencies" and "rationale" fields to each phase

5. **TESTING STRATEGY** (use coverage.json):
   - Address current test coverage gaps
   - Specify which test files to create/modify
   - Include edge cases and integration tests

**VALIDATION RULES:**

- ✅ Every task MUST reference specific files from code inventory
- ✅ Every task MUST consider existing patterns from patterns.json
- ✅ Every phase MUST have dependency-ordered tasks with rationale
- ✅ Risk assessment MUST address breaking changes and dependencies
- ✅ Testing strategy MUST address gaps from coverage.json
- ✅ NO time estimates (hours/minutes) - use complexity levels instead
- ✅ NO questions in plan - answer everything

**EXAMPLE TASK (GOOD):**
"IMPL-003: Modify generators/planning_generator.py lines 232-285 - Replace _generate_plan_internal() with _generate_plan_with_agent() async method that launches Task agent with coderef context"

**EXAMPLE TASK (BAD):**
"IMPL-003: Implement AI agent integration following existing patterns"
