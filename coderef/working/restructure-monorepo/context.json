  "feature_name": "restructure-monorepo",
  "description": "Restructure the monorepo to remove the widget system and simplify architecture. Move PromptingWorkflow from a loadable widget to a direct React component. Delete packages/widgets/ directory, remove custom widget build scripts (build-widgets.js), and consolidate the project structure to packages/core, packages/dashboard, and packages/electron-app.",
  "goal": "Fix TypeScript build errors caused by duplicate type declarations in the widget system while simplifying the overall architecture. The current structure has type conflicts between the original widget package and the new component-based approach. Removing the widget system entirely will resolve these conflicts and reduce complexity.",
  "requirements": [
    "Delete packages/widgets/ directory entirely",
    "Remove build-widgets.js script from scripts/",
    "Move PromptingWorkflow component to packages/dashboard/src/components/",
    "Update build configuration and npm scripts",
    "Ensure npm run build succeeds with no TypeScript errors",
    "Maintain full functionality on both web (Next.js) and Electron platforms"
  ],
  "out_of_scope": [
    "Adding new features to PromptingWorkflow",
    "Fixing scroll issues on web app or Electron (note: user mentioned these but they're separate from restructuring)",
    "Redesigning component architecture"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Build must pass after restructuring (npm run build)",
    "Both web app (dashboard) and Electron app must function correctly after changes",
    "Preserve git history and existing commits"
